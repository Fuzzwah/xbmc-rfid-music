							RFID Music
				******************************
This python script listens for input from an RFID reader. When a card
is swiped it checks a flatfile database to find the playlist which is
assigned to the card. Playback of the playlist is triggered in XBMC.

You need to configure a few things in the conf.py file.

The card to playlist database is managed by the addcard.py script.

The whole system was created for use on a Raspberry Pi running XBian.
If you're running XBMC on top of a different system, you may run into
problems. I'm sorry but I can't really help you with support.
